## Closing the Loop on Localization

Localization, mapping, visual place recognition and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) techniques are never the end, but rather a means to enable higher level tasks for robots and people alike. Major advances in localization capability have been made in the robotics, computer vision and machine learning fields, especially over the past two decades with the advent of mature SLAM systems and modern machine-learning driven approaches. Yet localization technology is still sparsely deployed in enduring large scale commercial applications, and despite the adage that “SLAM is solved”, for many applied roboticists it is abundantly clear that there are substantial challenges to still overcome.  

Involving both researchers and end-users from industry, this workshop will focus on the key reasons we are developing localization and mapping systems, and use those insights to drive a reflection on the key methods by which we are approaching localization research. We’ll evaluate whether there are new innovations required in techniques, how we can improve the metrics and benchmarks by which we assess performance in the research field to make them better proxies of performance in actual deployed situations. To maximize inclusivity we are providing substantial funding support to support researchers from under-represented and lower socio-economic regions to attend and participate in the workshop.

### Provocative Questions We Hope to Make Progress on as a Community

- what are the specific use cases for full SLAM approaches, when is semi-supervised or collaborative SLAM 'enough', and when do we only need localization and/or visual place recognition?
- are the current performance metrics we use like Recall@X sufficient for enabling real-world utility? What better performance metrics could we design and support as a community?
- how do we currently benchmark localization systems, and is our reliance in the research community on passive dataset-based testing hurting us in the long run? What could we do better, including the use of simulation and real-robot benchmark testing platforms?
- are our research goals as a field too focused on beating the previous state-of-the-art by a few percent? What other goals could we better pursue, like generality?
- viewpoint- and appearance-invariance have emerged as two of the key themes shaping much vision-based localization research... is this the right categorization?
- localization is a vibrant field across robotics, computer vision and machine learning fields - is this a good thing, bad thing, or somewhere in the middle?

### Call for Submissions

We invite you to submit high-quality extended abstracts, aligned with the theme of our workshop. Also, see [competition](https://tinyurl.com/Localization2023#competition) and [financial support](https://tinyurl.com/Localization2023#support-for-under-represented-researchers).

#### Scope of Potential Research Contributions

- Novel or updated evaluation metrics
- Encoding equivariance or invariance in place representations
- Semantics based localization
- Natural language, localization and navigation
- Large language models for place recognition and localization
- Foundation models for localization
- Neural implicit representations and models for mapping and localization

#### Format

We invite submissions in an extended abstract format: no longer than two pages excluding references (i.e., 2 + n). Please use IROS's suggested Latex [format](http://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php) and upload a PDF (see below). The review process will be single blind, that is, the authors' names are not required to be aonymmized, aligned with IROS paper submissions.

#### Submission Process
Please upload your paper through [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/2023/IROS/Workshop/Localization). In the abstract field, you only need to mention whether you are submitting new work or it is an abridged version of a parallel/accepted submission. Accepted papers will be presented as posters and a selected few will also have an opportunity for lightning talks. These papers will be publicly accessible through the workshop webpage in a non-archival format, thus allowing future submission to archival venues. At least one author must be registered to attend IROS 2023 workshops [registration](https://ieee-iros.org/registration-travel/).

## Competition
Our co-organizers from CMU: Peng Yin and Sebastian Scherer are currently running a place recognition competition. The winners will have the opportunity to present their work at this workshop. For more details, please check back on 05 Jul. 

## Prizes and Awards

The workshop will provide substantial prizes in the following categories:

- Best Overall Presentation Award, sponsored by Nvidia:
    - 1 Jetson Orin + RTX 4090 GPU and
    - Jetson Nano to each co-author to a max of 5 authors.
- Runner-up Paper Presentation Award, given to the student presenters at the spotlight sessions.
- Runner-up Poster Presentation Award, given to the student presenters at the poster sessions.
- Most engaging speaker amongst our invited speakers
- Most active participant, actively engaging throughout the workshop event


## Support for Under-Represented Researchers

We aim to provide opportunities for all researchers to be able to attend and foster further research in this area. We are proposing this scholarship program for researchers from under-represented geographic regions and demographics, totaling AUD 5000, which they can use for:

- funding IROS 2023 workshop registration fees to enable attendance at this workshop
- travel grants providing partial or full support for travel to attend the physical conference
- hardware support including GPUs
- software license support to help with conducting research in this area

Please use this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/gY4wx3G63U) to apply for this support. Due to a limited capacity, we cannot guarantee supporting everyone, but we encourage you to apply as it will only take a few minutes.
