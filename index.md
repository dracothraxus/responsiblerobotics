## What Good is Visual Localization?

Localization, mapping, visual place recognition and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) and systems are never the end, but rather a means to enable higher level tasks for robots and people alike. Major advances in localization capability have been made in the robotics, computer vision and machine learning fields, especially over the past two decades with the advent of mature SLAM systems and modern machine-learning driven approaches. Yet localization technology is still sparsely and very specifically deployed in enduring large scale commercial applications, and despite the adage that “SLAM is solved”, for many applied roboticists it is abundantly clear that there are substantial challenges to still overcome.  

Involving both researchers and end-users from industry, this workshop will focus on the key reasons we are developing localization and mapping systems, and use those insights to drive a reflection on the key methods by which we are approaching localization research. We’ll evaluate whether there are new innovations required in techniques, how we can improve the metrics and benchmarks by which we assess performance in the research field to make them better proxies of performance in actual deployed situations. To maximize inclusivity we are providing substantial funding support to support researchers from under-represented and lower socio-economic regions to attend and participate in the workshop.
